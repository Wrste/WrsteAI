The future of artificial intelligence has two sides. Reasonable use of artificial intelligence technology can really increase efficiency and reduce manpower investment, thus reducing costs. If artificial intelligence is used improperly, however, it will result in bad influences. For instance, AI conveying incorrect data to Service users intentionally will bring a lot of troubles to users or humanity. We don't know cover too much on how to use artificial intelligence properly here. We only focuse on how to realize artificial intelligence instead of a data analysis training tool based on a bunch of algorithms.

1. How do we understand the true meaning of artificial intelligence?
<br/><br/>
When I marvel at the great Nature gives us something that other animals don’t have of god'sfabulous creation, I also thought that nature is actually a manufacturer of intelligent creatures. Nature has different products. For now, humans can be said to be a very successful product. Nature gives us something that other animals don’t have Of course you can also say that we have evolved ourselves, but we have to admit that Nature has given us some conditions and opportunities for evolution, and we still have in the limited control of nature, at present we are still unable to change some of the essential attributes, such as life, these attributes are written as constants above our bottom gene, what we can do is to constantly improve their own modified region perfects and modifies the genes and transmits them through breeding. We act as temporary programmers for the gene. As for what we write and whether genes are adopted and used for transmission, the gene source code has its own set of standards and regular. Understanding the full-body genetic design we can understand, we humans are just like the gene control program, we can design a perfect intelligent individual to record and specify the program through the same source code as the built-in gene, and other places can be programmed by themselves. Perfection, in addition to the fixed parameters can not be changed, this program will be a free individual, we only need to teach the AI ​​framework how to modify the program source code for themselves, how to improve themselves, this AI framework can be based on the environment to upgrade for themselves. I believe that you now have simple understanding of artificial intelligence. Next, we will analyze the implementation of AI step by step, and give more important details!

人工智能的未来，是拥有两面性的，合理使用人工智能技术可以真正提高效率减少人力投入从而达到降低成本，但如果人工智能使用不得当将会产生一些不好的影响，比如AI故意传达错误数据给服务使用者，给用户或人类带来许多麻烦，怎么合理使用人工智能这里不做过多说明，这里只告诉您怎么做可以实现真正人工智能而不是基于一堆算法做出来的数据分析训练工具。

1.我们该怎么理解人工智能的真正含义？
<br/><br/>
当我惊叹大自然这个造物主鬼斧神工的时候，我也想过大自然其实也是创造智能生物的一个厂商，大自然有不同的产品就目前来说人类可以说是一个很成功的产品，大自然给我们内置了很多其他动物没有的一些东西，让我们成为了万物之灵长，当然你也可以说是我们自己进化过来的，但不得不承认大自然给了我们进化需要的一些条件和机遇，而且我们依然在大自然的可控范围，目前我们依然在有些本质属性上都还不能改变，比如寿命，这些属性就像常量一样写入了我们的底层基因上面，我们能够做的就是不断完善自己的可修改区域对基因进行完善和修订，通过繁殖将基因传递下去，我们充当就是这个基因的暂时编程员，至于我们编写什么内容和基因是否采纳并用于传递，基因源码上是有自己的一套标准和规则的。理解完整体基因设计我们就可以理解，我们人也就像基因控制的程序一样，我们可以设计出一个个完美的智能个体通过内置基因一样的源码来记录和规定程序，其他地方都可以由程序自行完善，除了固定的参数不可改变，这个程序就将会是个自由的个体，我们只需要教会AI框架怎么为自己修改程序源码，怎样完善自己，这个AI框架就可以根据环境来自己给自己进行升级。我相信你看了这个对人工智能有了一个简单的了解，接下来我们会一步一步来分析人工智能的实现当然还有一些重要的细节说明！
